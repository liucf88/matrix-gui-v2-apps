<h1> PRU - Memory Access using L3 and DDR </h1>

<p>In this example, the PRU reads three values from external DDR memory and stores these values 
in shared L3 using programmable constant table entries. The example initially 
loads 3 values into the external DDR RAM. The PRU configures its Constant 
Table Programmable Pointer Register 1 (CTPPR_1) to point to appropriate 
locations in the DDR memory and the L3 memory. The values are then read from 
the DDR memory and stored into the L3 memory using the values in the 30th and 
31st entries of the constant table.</p>

<p>See the PRU Software examples project in the SDK under example-applications.
The source code for both the ARM and the PRU can be found there. </p>
