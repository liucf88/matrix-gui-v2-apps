<h1> PRU - Miscellaneous Operations </h1>

<p>This example performs the following operations:<br>
1. Extracting Masked Bits - 4 bit values are extracted from a 32 bit integer<br>
2. Bubble Sorting - The extracted bits are use in an implemented bubble sorting 
algorithm <br>
3. Thresholding - The sorted array is thresholded by applying a cut-off value</p>

<p>See the PRU Software examples project in the SDK under example-applications.
The source code for both the ARM and the PRU can be found there. </p>
