<h1> PRU - Access constant table </h1>

<p> In this demonstration, the PRU uses the internal constant table to 
write data into  Host Port Interface (HPI) registers from external DDR 
memory. This example demonstrates accessing both fixed entries and 
programmable entries in the constant table. </p> 
<p>See the PRU Software examples project in the SDK under example-applications.
The source code for both the ARM and the PRU can be found there. </p>
