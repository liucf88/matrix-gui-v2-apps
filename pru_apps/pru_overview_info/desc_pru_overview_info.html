<h1> Programmable Real-time Unit Subsystem Overview </h1>

<h2>- Two independent programmable real-time cores with 32 bit Load/Store Architecture </h2>
<h2>- 4K Byte instruction Ram per core / 512 Byte data Ram per core </h2>
<h2>- Good for handling real-time system events with tight real-time constraints </h2>
<h2>- Efficient for manipulating packed memory mapped data structures </h2>
<h2>- Supports access to all system peripherals </h2>
<h2>- Reduces system power consumption by allowing switching off both ARM and DSP clocks and evaluation of events before waking up ARM and/or DSP</h2>
<h2>- Includes many programming examples which can be used as building blocks
for your custom application. Each demo application has associated source code for 
both the PRU and ARM9 </h2>
