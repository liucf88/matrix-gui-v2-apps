<h1> Suspend/Resume Debugging: PRCM Register Snapshot before Suspend </h1>

<h2> This program provides advanced debugging information for power management.
It allows the user a simple method to quickly display a snapshot of the state of the 
PRCM registers that was taken just prior to suspend.  The snapshot is taken
before the jump occurs into SRAM idle code.  Used to debug suspend/resume problems.
This debugging feature is intended primarily for PM developers and power users.</h2>
