<h1> Power Statistics </h1>

 This program provides advanced debugging information for power management.
The first set of information that is displayed in the dump gives the state 
statistics for each power domain.  Each power domain state is shown with
an associated off-mode counter in parenthesis.  The RET_LOGIC_OFF counter
refers to the logic off counter, and the RET_MEMBANKN_OFF counter refers to
the per-bank memory off counter. <br> Following that, each of the clock 
domain active clocks is displayed along with the associated use count.  The use
count refers to the number of enabled downstream clocks from this clock domain.
Once the count reaches 0, the clock domain can be put to sleep.
