<h1> Camera Streaming Application </h1>

<p>
This application demonstrates streaming of 8-bit UYVY 4:2:2 data from Leopard Imaging LI-3M02 daughter card with MT9T111 sensor. Here, driver allocated buffers are used to capture data from the sensor and display to any active display device (LCD/DVI/TV) in VGA resolution (640x480)
</p>

<span style="color:red">NOTE: Connect LI-3M02 daughter card to the J31 connector on the EVM at boot-up.</span>

<h2> 
Media Controller Framework has been adopted on 2.6.37 kernel, here:</h2>
<p>- Media device topology is exposed to userspace and connected through pads
</p>
<p>- Links can be activated/deactivated from userspace
</p>
<p>- Each block parameters can be accessed through read/write/ioctl calls
</p>
<p>- Image streaming parameters can be configured at each pad
