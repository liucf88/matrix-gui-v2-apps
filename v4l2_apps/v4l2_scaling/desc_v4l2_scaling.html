<h1> V4L2 Scaling Example Application </h1>

<p>
This example application demonstrates scaling of data on display video pipe, data is scalled horizontally by three times and vertically by eight. Horizontal colorbars are displayed in RGB656 color mode with WQVGA resolution.
</p>
<p>
Hardware block consists of two scaling units, both horizontal and vertical scaling units are indepentent units and can be used individually or simultaneously. Scaling is not explicitly exposed at the API level. Instead, the horizontal and vertical scaling factors are based on the display window and the image cropping rectangle. The horizontal scaling factor is computed by dividing the width of the display window by the width of the cropping rectangle. Similarly, the vertical scaling factor is computed by dividing the height of the display window by the height of the cropping rectangle.
